As the CTO of Container Security at [Wiz](https://www.wiz.io), I am focused on solving Kubernetes and container security challenges at scale, working with the largest and most strategic customers of Wiz.

I am passionate about Go programming, Kubernetes Security, Human and Workload Identities in Kubernetes and the Cloud, Kubernetes Networking (from CNIs, through Service Meshes to low-level iptables and primitives), Observability, Cloud Native Architecture and Development, DevOps and other cool technologies. I'm also about always keeping a growth mindset and maintaining a learning and courses streak.

I've been in the industry for the past 15+ years. My main background is in Computer Science (BSc, MSc), software engineering, and IT. I specialize in Go, Python, C/C++, Kubernetes, cybersecurity, and cloud native development.

For the past 3 years, I've been deeply involved in cloud native technologies, participating in CNCF meetups and the Kubernetes community. I develop tools and guides to help organizations easily and safely deploy Kubernetes and container solutions.

Outside of work, I love playing blues & rock on the guitar. My biggest musical influence and guitar hero is, without a doubt, John Mayer!
